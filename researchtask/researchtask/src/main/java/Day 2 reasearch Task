STATELESS API
The server does not store any information about the client's previous requests.
•	Every request contains all the information needed to process it.
•	Server treats each request as independent.
•	No client session is stored on the server.
Eg:Authorization like password.
STATEFUL API
The server remembers the client's state between requests (like sessions or login ).
•	If I log in, the server creates a session.
•	I don’t need to send credentials every time the server remembers my session.
•	Eg:Post,Get,Put etc.
